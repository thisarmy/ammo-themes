Custom Ammo theme building is still in beta, but if you're brave enough you can
try it out if you really want to.

Just remember that it can still break at any time as the way themes work are
still in flux. We're adding features and some of them will likely become
"required" features that all themes have to support in order to be considered
"working".

The URL for getting to themes is still hidden so that people don't get there by
accident, but if you want to you can go there directly:
http://get.someammo.com/themes

There's some documentation that might be slightly outdated at the moment here:
http://get.someammo.com/themes/documentation
(It catches up with current reality every once in a while.)

And the default snippets are here:
http://get.someammo.com/themes/snippets
(widgets and snippets are explained in the documentation)

The code for all the built-in themes is available here:
https://github.com/thisarmy/ammo-themes
(That should help as some decent examples.)

The following sites already use custom themes:
http://blankspace.co.za/
http://hatsoff.co.za/
http://www.lilarose.co.za/
http://catalogue.lilarose.co.za/

Those were all built by Cuie&Co. (http://cuieandco.com/) who share an office
with us, so perhaps they are at a bit of an advantage :)

We're also working on "ThemeKit" which is a standalone node.js-based app that
you can run on your own computer for building and testing themes locally in
your own text editor, but that's still very rough, completely tied to the rest
of our codebase and not as easily installable as I would like.
